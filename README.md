## The birth of Manu Mana 
When Jesse Stratford heard his classmate Halmai McRae pitch the idea of making an app to track the movements of native birds and record them on a suburb map, he was reminded of his mother’s stories about the cultural significance of pīwakawaka.  Jesse felt a longing to know more about the cultural and spiritual significance of birds in his Māori culture. With this thought in mind, he suggested that the app could also share and capture stories from Māori culture about native birds. Thus, the bird tracking app previously known as Flitter was reborn as Manu Mana. 


## Kaupapa/Purpose  
Multiple peer-reviewed studies show that the conservation of connections between biological diversity, language and culture builds a strong pathway for protecting the future wellbeing of people and nature. 

Manu Mana is more than a web application: the project is about design, protecting taonga, relationships, and learning in a digital age.
It is also an exploration of what it means to be an ethical technologist working in Aotearoa. 



## Manu Mana APP (MVP)

This repository contains the code files for the MVP of a bird tracking application that takes a Te Reo Māori language first approach to biodiversity reporting by communities within Aotearoa.  The app also shares stories about the cultural and spiritual significance of Aotearoa’s native birds with reference to Māori culture. The team acknowledges that bird names and meanings vary within iwi groups across Aotearoa. Biodiversity reporting with a Te Reo Māori first approach requires careful consideration in any future iterations of the Manu Mana APP to ensure both the inclusivity and autonomy of dilectal variations of Te Reo Māori.  While learning more about the use of Te Reo Māori in biodiversity reporting, the team learned about key academic research in this area, please scroll down to view links to related research.  
 
## Under MVP not registered users are able to:
1. View recent sightings of birds in Poneke via a map and a list of sightings
2. View a list of, and information about, native birds that may be seen in and around Poneke

## Under MVP registered users are able to:
1. Add a bird sighting to the map interface
2. Add a bird sighting to the list of all bird sightings
3. View birds they have seen on a user page
 
## What would a mature Manu Mana App feature?
1. Users would be able to add a comment to the bird profile page about what that bird means to them/their iwi/or any other points of significance to them.
2. There would be information regarding the conservation status of the bird, and resources for ways the user can help these birds thrive.

## Ethical considerations 

Māori language and cultural stories are toanga that should be treated with care and consideration. 
Furthermore, Māori Data Sovereignty, must be considered in Aotearoa: “New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world that has adopted a whole-of-government approach to safeguarding Māori cultural heritage. In 2020, the Waitangi Tribunal – a permanent inquiry into the treatment of the Maori people – advised data should be included in this heritage.” Source:https://techmonitor.ai/policy/privacy-and-data-protection/maori-data-sovereignty-new-zealand-indigenous
